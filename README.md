 SCT_ML_Task02 - Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project is a part of my Machine Learning Internship at **Skillcraft Technology**. The objective is to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

# Project Overview

- **Task Code**: SCT_ML_Task02
- **Internship**: Skillcraft Technology
- **Objective**: Segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.

##  Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to personalize offers and understand their customers' spending behavior. Using clustering, we group customers into segments like:
- High Income ‚Äì High Spend
-  Low Income ‚Äì High Spend
-  Average Income ‚Äì Low Spend, etc.


##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (StandardScaler, KMeans)

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Scaling**
2. **Optimal Cluster Detection** via Elbow Method
3. **KMeans Clustering** (with `k=5`)
4. **2D Visualization** with star markers
5. **Cluster Labels** added to the original dataset

##  What I Learned

- The concept of **unsupervised learning**
- Practical use of **customer segmentation**
- Importance of **feature scaling**
- How to use **Elbow Method** and visualize clusters

##  Results

The dataset was segmented into distinct clusters. These segments help businesses to:
- Target customers with relevant offers
- Improve customer retention
- Personalize shopping experiences
